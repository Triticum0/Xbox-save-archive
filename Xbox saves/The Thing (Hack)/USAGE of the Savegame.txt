This mod will enable :
- Level Select (all levels unlocked)
- Load Save Game ingame menu option (may not work in some Xbox models)
- All Weapons and Accessories at the beginning of every level
- Full Ammo for All Weapons
- Invincible / Invulnerable Player
- Invincible / Invulnerable NPC (every ally or team member)

The file can be edited with a Text editor, so each mode can be set to 1 (enabled) or 0 (disabled) selectively.

To enable the mod, place it in the root of the installed game (backup the previous "TheThing.reg" file first before overwriting it, in case of any incompatibility).
