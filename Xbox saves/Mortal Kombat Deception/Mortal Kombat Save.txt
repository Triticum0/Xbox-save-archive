I made this save so you can have everything really unlocked.  Not only that, but the fight stats are all fresh, as well as your Koinage is set to all zeroes, although you won't really need any Koins after installing this save.  I wasn't going to post this save, because it will let anybody play any character on XBL, but since a trainer was made, and some people started uploading other saves, I decided that I might as well release a better method to unlocking everything as well as keeping all the stats and Konquest Mode fresh for you.  Also, the profile name is PLAYER1, so you don't have to use another person's name for your profile.  I know that people have always bitched about the profile names I've used in saves.  So without further adieu, just use A, A, A, A, A, A as the passcode and enjoy another fine release from your number one save hacker, Brien L. Johnson.
