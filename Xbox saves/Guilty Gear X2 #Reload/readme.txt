The Axledental DJ presents,
My Guilty Gear XX #Reload Xbox game save from the Japanese NTSC game.
It runs in All English/USA mode on an NTSC-American XBOX BTW. :-) 
(UDATA 53410002)
THANKS goto HADES (iamhades@uol.com.br) for beating Survival mode up to 520 fighters!

I've played the games for about 45 hours now.
This game save gives you:
All fighters in Arcade mode are unlocked with EX & SP modes. (Kliff & Justice don't have an EX mode)
Mission Mode has about 32 missions completed.
I accuired about 45 hours of gameplay for GGXX Reload.
Survival mode beaten up to 520 by Hades.
Nothing completed in Story mode.
Beaten Arcade mode with about 4 fighters.
Unlocked Guilty Gear/Guilty Gear X Mode
Unlocked Kliff
Unlocked Justice


When the USA version release of GGXX #Reload comes out, I'm sure this game save wil work with it.
Seeing how the Japanese release is allready in FULL english.
